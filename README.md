# Market-Basket-Analysis

##Using the apriori algorithm, dynamically, to recommend goods frequently bought together. 

Items in GOODSLIST automatically added for selection.

Transactions are saved in csv to retrieve later, and allow further improvement in recommendations.
Also a tkinter GUI that looks adequate and allows all functions. 


Discounts offered on frequently bought together items.


Issues-
File addresses are complete, change according to system, or root.
Apriori is Inefficient for large amounts of data.
